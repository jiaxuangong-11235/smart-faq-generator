<h1>FAQs for Module 7 Homework</h1>
<h2>Q1. What is the main objective of the homework assignment?</h2>
<p>The main objective is to build custom Vertex AI training and prediction
pipelines to predict the likelihood of patients developing breast cancer.</p>
<h2>Q2. What datasets are used in the training and prediction pipelines?</h2>
<p>The training pipeline uses the file breast_cancer_train.csv and the prediction
pipeline uses breast_cancer_test.csv.</p>
<h2>Q3. What steps are involved in the training pipeline?</h2>
<p>The training pipeline involves loading the dataset, splitting it into training
and validation partitions, normalizing the dataset, training a Logistic
regression model, and assessing the model's performance using accuracy and F1
score.</p>
<h2>Q4. What should be included in the submission for Gradescope?</h2>
<p>The submission should include screenshots of the results pasted back into the
provided file, which should be uploaded as a PDF.</p>
<h2>Q5. What is required in Step 1 of the assignment?</h2>
<p>In Step 1, you need to draw the directed acyclic graph (DAG) for your pipeline
design and label every arc while avoiding model leakage.</p>
<h2>Q6. What is the purpose of Step 5 in the assignment?</h2>
<p>Step 5 involves creating a simple test pipeline to verify the overall pipeline
setup by defining a pipeline function and corresponding job with the same inputs
and outputs as the project.</p>
<h2>Q7. What should be done in Step 3 regarding Google Cloud Storage (GCS)?</h2>
<p>In Step 3, you need to create a new bucket in GCS for the homework assignment
and load your training and validation datasets into this bucket.</p>
